This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.","issued":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","links":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4039","severity":"not yet assigned","normalized_severity":"Unknown","package":{"id":"","name":"libstdc++6","version":"","kind":"binary"},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"debian","name":"Debian GNU/Linux","version":"12 (bookworm)","version_code_name":"bookworm","version_id":"12","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)"},"repository":{},"fixed_in_version":""}},"package_vulnerabilities":{"34":["4078075"],"32":["5871894","5871282"],"104":["3887619"],"4":["953833"],"78":["5872241","5870343"],"46":["953835"],"176":["1092922"],"80":["6060700","6059926"],"174":["1688727"],"110":["3887604"],"130":["4714924","4715087","4713274","4704594"],"154":["859830","853064"],"152":["1688773"],"134":["859838","853072"],"158":["4810467","4810412","4810295","4809141","4808880"],"98":["1688719"],"60":["1403951","1391566","1375284","1325772","1303622","1301739","1299748"],"14":["1134861","1134851"],"160":["3895697","3895326","3898357"],"58":["1403617","1391615","1375295","1325781","1303641","1301814","1299767"],"54":["1688688"],"124":["1688697"],"128":["5872113","5870013"],"156":["859864","853102"],"146":["4810470","4810417","4810299","4809145","4808900"],"136":["4715097","4714860","4713281","4704633"],"84":["571389"],"172":["1688761"],"140":["1688706"],"10":["938241"],"12":["1688686"],"166":["5889503","5889250"],"106":["3887638"],"108":["3887667"],"164":["569466"]},"enrichments":{}}
